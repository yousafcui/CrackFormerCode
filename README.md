# CrackFormer: Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Swin Transformer Framework for Pavement Crack Detection

CrackFormer is an advanced deep learning framework for automatic pavement crack detection and segmentation. It combines a **Mask R-CNN** for extracting region proposals, a **Swin Transformer V3** for learning multi-scale visual features, and an **Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning agent** for optimizing crack boundary refinement. The model is designed for high segmentation fidelity and can be deployed in real-time on both GPUs and edge devices like Jetson Nano.
